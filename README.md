Fashion MNIST Neural Network
============================

This repository contains a Keras and Numpy implementation of a neuron network for the Fashion MNIST problem. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items, such as shoes, shirts, and bags. The goal is to train a model to classify these clothing items into 10 different classes.

Implementation
--------------

The neuron network is implemented in a Jupyter notebook using the Keras and Numpy libraries. The notebook contains detailed explanations of the code, as well as visualizations of the results.

Report
------

The repository also includes a report discussing the results of the model and analyzing its performance. The report includes a summary of the dataset, the model architecture, and the training process, as well as a discussion of the results and suggestions for future work.

Running the code
----------------

To run the code in the Jupyter notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

*   Keras
*   Numpy

You will also need to download the Fashion MNIST dataset from the [Keras website](https://keras.io/datasets/#fashion-mnist-database-of-fashion-articles). The dataset should be placed in a `data` folder in the root directory of the repository.

Once the dependencies are installed and the dataset is downloaded, you can run the code by opening the Jupyter notebook and running the cells.
